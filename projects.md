## Personal Website 
My first personal website was made using React and Chakra UI. Using the UI library made it incredibly hard to update/manage, especially since Chakra switched versions right after I developed it. I am not a fan of the current documentation Chakra has so I switched to just HTML, CSS, and JS for the website you are reading this from.
```
function catFunc(out, fileName) {
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
let header = document.createElement('div');
header.textContent = `This is the content of ${fileName}:`;
output.appendChild(header);
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
let outputtext = document.createElement('div');
outputtext.innerText = out;
outputtext.style.paddingLeft = "20px";
output.appendChild(outputtext);
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
};
```
This is some sample code from the terminal website. This is code for the 'cat' function where the output variable is a 'div' for the output text.
## HackUTD
Worked with a team of 3 others. We made a website that took in a url and used a webscraper to analyze data from that url. I worked on frontend for this project and did version control through Github.
