## [HackKU 2025](https://hack-ku-25.vercel.app/)
Worked with a team of 3 others. We made a website that took a song or artist request. Then used gemini API to generate songs similar to the input. Then we sent the similar songs to spotify API and used a JavaScript generate function to create html objects on screen for each song. We also made it so the user could send this to spotify (this only worked on my account because of spotify APIs developer rules). I was in charge of the JavaScript generate function and I also helped with the connections between APIs and the send to spotify button.
## Personal Website 
My first personal website was made using React and Chakra UI. Using the UI library made it incredibly hard to update/manage, especially since Chakra switched versions right after I developed it. I am not a fan of the current documentation Chakra has so I switched to just HTML, CSS, and JS for the website you are reading this from.
```
function catFunc(out, fileName) {
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
let header = document.createElement('div');
header.textContent = `This is the content of ${fileName}:`;
output.appendChild(header);
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
let outputtext = document.createElement('div');
outputtext.innerText = out;
outputtext.style.paddingLeft = "20px";
output.appendChild(outputtext);
output.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
};
```
This is some sample code from the terminal website. This is code for the 'cat' function where the output variable is a 'div' for the output text.
## HackUTD 2024
Worked with a team of 3 others. We made a website that took in a url and used a webscraper to analyze data from that url. I worked on frontend for this project and did version control through Github.
